Note that the eureka server will be connected to by the client with the defaultZone url from port:8080
Note that the api in the YAML is for the swagger
Note to access the client from eureka server i.e api gateway use this url http://localhost:8080/resource/swagger-ui.html#/ (This is because swagger is enabled on the client)
The client is on http://localhost:8089/swagger-ui.html#/
The eureka client is set to false by default in the application yaml file to enable it set the enabled property to true - same configuration can be applied to swagger.
